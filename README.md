:card_index_dividers: Some Examples

#### 1. Searching
```--search```  accepts one argument string which it uses to search and scrape the requested products on 
the e-commerce websites. So, to use this, run the python script followed by the --search argument and the 
search string. The search string should be in double quotes if it have two or more words. Example:
```
For Mac
python3 slash.py --search "philips hue"

For Windows
python slash.py --search "philips hue"
```
```

#### 2. Sorting
```--sort``` accepts one or more arguments that determine how the tool sorts and filters the requested products
after scraping. The first value is used to initially sort and filter the results of the scraping. The arguments
following the first one are not required but will be used to further sort the filtered results. Example:
```
For Mac
python3 slash.py --search "philips hue" --sort pr

For Windows
python slash.py --search "philips hue" --sort pr
```
```
| timestamp           | title                                       | price   | website   |

```
#### 3. Sort Order
The ```--des``` flag can be set to sort the requested products in a non-increasing order. This flag will be 
actually used when coupled with ```--sort```. Example:
```
For Mac
python3 slash.py --search "philips hue" --sort pr --des

For Windows
python slash.py --search "philips hue" --sort pr --des
```
```
| timestamp           | title                                       | price   | website   |

```

#### 4. Result length
The maximum number of results that are scraped from each website can be set using the ```--num``` argument. It accepts
an integer value ```n``` and then returns ```n``` results from each website. Note that tool returns a maximum of 
the value of ```n``` and the number of results on the webiste. By default this value is set to 3. Example:
```
For Mac
python3 slash.py --search "philips hue" --num 5

For Windows
python slash.py --search "philips hue" --num 5
```
```

:thought_balloon: Use Case
---
* ***Students***: Students coming to university are generally on a budget and time constraint and generally spend hours wasting time to search for products on Websites. Slash is the perfect tool for these students that slashes all the unnecessary details on a website and helps them get prices for a product across multiple websites.Make the most of this tool in the upcoming Black Friday Sale.

Using slash, they can create their own dataset in real time and format it as per their needs so that they can focus on what is actually inportant.

:page_facing_up: Why
---
- In a market where we are spoilt for choices, we often look for the best deals.  
- The ubiquity of internet access has leveled the retail playing field, making it easy for individuals and businesses to sell products without geographic limitation. In 2020, U.S. e-commerce sales, receiving a boost due to the COVID-19 pandemic, grew 44% and represented more than 21% of total retail sales, according to e-commerce information source Internet Retailer.
- The growth of e-commerce has not only changed the way customers shop, but also their expectations of how brands approach customer service, personalize communications, and provide customers choices.
- E-commerce market has prompted cut throat competition amongst dealers, which is discernable through the price patterns for products of major market players. Price cuts are somewhat of a norm now and getting the best deal for your money can sometimes be a hassle (even while online shopping).
- This is what Slash aims to reduce by giving you an easy to use, all in one place solution for finding the best deals for your products that major market dealers have to offer!
- Slash in its current form is for people who have some understanding of python and are comfortable in using the command line interface to interact with systems.
- Future updates aim to encompass a wide variety of users irrespective of their computer knowledge and background.
